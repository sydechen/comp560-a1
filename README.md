# Constraint Satisfaction: Map Coloring
Runs backtracking search and local search to find map coloring solution using Python 3.8

## Run
To run in terminal, use command: 

`python <path\to\main.py> <path\to\inputfile.txt>`

Replace the items in <> with actual paths to main.py and your input file. 
It is easiest to `cd` to directory where main.py exists then type:

`python main.py <path\to\inputfile.txt>`

Executing will print the backtracking search solution followed by attempting the local search solution. Number of steps in each search will be printed at the top of the solution.

If you are on Windows and python is not added to PATH, replace the `python` command with the path to your python interpreter eg.

`C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe main.py <path\to\inputfile.txt>`
