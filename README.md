# comp560-a1
Runs backtracking search and local search to find map coloring solution

## Run
To run in terminal, use command: 

`python <path\to\main.py> <path\to\inputfile.txt>`

Replace the items in <> with actual paths to main.py and your input file. It is easiest to `cd` to directory where main.py exists:

`python main.py <path\to\inputfile.txt>`

Executing will print the backtracking search solution followed by attempting the local search solution.

If you are on Windows and python is not added to PATH, replace the `python` command with the path to your python interpreter eg.
 
`C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe main.py <path\to\inputfile.txt>`
